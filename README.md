VS Extention to provide an ability to Import/Export list of extensions

# Looking for maintainer !!!

Last year I stopped using Windows and Visual Studio - my new gig is Mac/Linux now.
These days I don't even have a single Windows installation to develop/test this code.

If you like to take over this project, I'll be happy to make you the co-owner for this repository and the corresponging marketplace.visualstudio.com account.
